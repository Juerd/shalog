Goal: a system for tracking physical objects

With a simple barcode driven user interface, the user can specify that a Thing
is either in a Container, at a Place, or in the hands of a Person.

Object hierachy:

    - Command
    - Item
    - Thing
        is Item
        has Container|Person|Place location
    - Container
        is Item
        is Place
        has Container|Place location
    - Place
        is Item
        has Place location
        can be "hidden", which also hides its Things from lists
    - Person
        is-a Place

These all share a single namespace, and are stored as simple JSON-compatible
objects. Metadata is mostly stored as text strings; no need for fancy things.

Input is given as a list of scanned barcodes. The list ends with a command,
which then operates on the given list. A command can require further operands,
given after the command.

Command "is-at":

    The second operand of is-at has to be a Place, or the special term
    "last-item", which uses the last item from the first operand as the
    location. "last-item" can be used if you accidentally scanned the location
    before scanning "is-at".

    hammer
    is-at
    infodesk
    -> result: hammer's new location is recorded

    # Note: indentation provided for legability; not required in input!
    spanner
    hammer
    is-at
    infodesk
    -> result: both hammer and spanner are now at infodesk

    spanner
    hammer
    infodesk
    is-at
    last-item
    -> result: same as above

    box42
    is-at
    shelfB3
    -> result: box42's location is updated to shelfB3

    hammer
    spanner
    -> result: incomplete input, no command given

Command "info":

    box42
    info
    -> result: info about box42's contents (as a thing, and as a location)

    hammer
    info
    -> result: information about the hammer's whereabouts and its recent history

    hammer
    screwdriver
    info
    -> result: error, info does not work on a list of objects

Command "help":

    hammer
    help
    -> result: error, help does not take arguments

    help
    -> result: short help text

Command "cancel" or "abort":

    hammer
    cancel
    -> result: empty stack

    hammer
    box42
    abort
    -> result: empty stack

Duplicate input as a shortcut:

    The "is-at" and "info" commands are both used much more than any of the
    other commands, so there is a faster way to use these, by repeating the
    input (scanning the barcode twice).

    The repeated object is the only entry:
        "<object> info"

    There are multiple entries:
        "is-at <object>"

    hammer
    henkdevries
    henkdevries
    -> result: just like "hammer / is-at / henkdevries"

    hammer
    shelfB3
    shelfB3
    -> result: hammer is (back) at shelf B3

    shelfB3
    LHQ
    LHQ
    -> result: the shelf itself now has a location: LHQ

    hammer
    spanner
    screwdriver
    box42
    -> result: still waiting for a command!
    henkdevries
    henkdevries
    -> result: Henk got the hammer, spanner, screwdriver, and a box (of things)

    hammer
    hammer
    -> Just like "hammer / info".
