Goal: a system for tracking physical objects

With a simple barcode driven user interface, the user can specify that a Thing
is either in a Container, at a Location, or in the hands of a Person.

Object hierachy:

    - Command
    - Thing
        has location
    - Person (does Thing)
        has location (not Container, not Person)
    - Container (does Thing, does Location)
        has location (not Person)
    - Location
        has location (not Container, not Person)
        can be "hidden", which also hides its Things from lists

These all share a single namespace, and are stored as simple JSON-compatible
objects. Metadata is mostly stored as text strings; no need for fancy things.

Input takes the form of a single thing, or a list. The list ends with a
command, which then operates on the given list.

Command "is-at":

    The second operand of is-at has to be a Location, or the special term
    "last-item", which uses the last item from the first operand as the
    location. "last-item" can be used if you accidentally scanned the location
    before scanning "is-at".

    hammer
    is-at
    infodesk
    -> result: hammer's new location is recorded

    hammer
    infodesk
    is-at
    last-item
    -> result: same as above

    # Note: indentation provided for legability; not required in input!
    list
        spanner
        hammer
    is-at
    infodesk
    -> result: both hammer and spanner are now at infodesk

    box42
    is-at
    shelfB3
    -> result: box42's location is updated to shelfB3

    hammer
    spanner
    -> result: error, spanner is not a valid command

Command "info":

    box42
    info
    -> result: info about box42's contents (as a thing, and as a location)

    hammer
    info
    -> result: information about the hammer's whereabouts and its recent history

    list
        hammer
        screwdriver
    info
    -> result: error, info does not work on a list

Command "help":

    hammer
    help
    -> result: error, help does not take arguments

    help
    -> result: short help text

Command "cancel" or "abort":

    hammer
    cancel
    -> result: empty stack

    list
        hammer
        box42
    abort
    -> result: empty stack

Implied "is-at" command:

    When operating on a single item (so there's no "list"), any Location (for
    example, a Person or a Container) can be used as a command. This implies
    the "is-at" command:

    hammer
    henkdevries
    -> result: just like "hammer / is-at / henkdevries"

    hammer
    shelfB3
    -> result: hammer is (back) at shelf B3

    shelfB3
    LHQ
    -> result: the shelf itself now has a location: LHQ

    list
        hammer
        spanner
        screwdriver
        box42
    -> result: still waiting for a command!
    henkdevries
    -> result: Henk got the hammer, spanner, screwdriver, and a box (of things)
